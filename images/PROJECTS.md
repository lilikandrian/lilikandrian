#### To Do List: Different design changes, more features and offline support
#### What is it? It...
is a Tropical Health Information System hence the word. This will be an open source project. That will help countries rampaged by tropical curable diseases. 
This system will provide comprehensive data on the tropical health diseases including potential cures. I am hoping it will be free to access. If you are interested in collaborating and/or donating. Your effort will be much appreciated.
The plan is to build a documentation site using Hugo or any other static site generator and make it a Progressive Web App since the people suffering the most from these most likely live in remote areas where hospitals are scarce. So network difficulties.
Now there will be 2 versions. A Progressive Static Web App and USSD. USSD for people who can't get a smartphone.

#### To Do List: The actual system build
#### What is it?
Now these 2 were intially supposed to be 1 system but i divided them becuase of the difficulty in building them. Biomme is a digital business card, networking tool and personal information storage.
Consider Biomme Linktree, Milkshake, Vcard and a Micro Landing side all rolled into 1.
BioEmergency is different it will be a decentralized medical health record storage with blockchain capability. Our aim is to offer a secure storage area where you can digitise your health record and store it which then you can share or can be accessed in time of need.
